### How Account Deletion Varies by Application

#### Social Media / Content-Heavy Apps

- **Cascade Delete:** Posts, comments, likes, media, and messages are removed along with the account.
- **Soft Delete Option:** Accounts can be marked deleted for a grace period (e.g., 30 days) before full removal.

#### Financial / Sensitive Apps (Banking, Health, etc.)

- **Strict Audit Requirements:** Cannot fully delete transaction or health records due to compliance.
- **Partial Deletion:** Personal identifiers (name, email, SSN) are removed; internal records remain anonymized.

#### Gaming / Platform Accounts

- **Soft Delete for Retention:** Keeps stats, achievements, and purchases for a period in case user returns.
- **Cascade Delete for Data:** Chat messages, avatars, or in-game content tied directly to the user are purged immediately.

#### Enterprise / SaaS

- **Customizable Retention:** Admins or the user can request deletion, but backups are kept for a defined period.
- **Anonymization for Analytics:** Remove personal info but preserve usage stats for insights.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Cascade deletion** is safest for public-facing apps where orphaned content could be problematic.
2. **Soft deletion** is safer for regulatory compliance, auditability, and user mistakes.
3. Many apps **combine both approaches**: mark deleted initially, then cascade after a grace period.

Account deletion handling varies with application type and **data sensitivity**:

### Low Sensitivity Apps

- **Confirmation dialog required**: user must explicitly confirm deletion.
- Immediate deletion of user profile and data.
- No extended grace period needed.

### Medium Sensitivity Apps

- Confirmation dialog **plus typing a phrase or re-entering email**.
- Optional **grace period**: account marked for deletion, reversible for 7–14 days.
- Soft delete preferred: anonymize sensitive fields, keep minimal data for analytics.

### High Sensitivity Apps (Banking, Health, Enterprise)

- **Two-step verification**: confirmation email or OTP before deletion.
- **Admin review** or approval for compliance.
- **Extended grace period**: 30 days or more before permanent deletion.
- **Anonymization**: redact sensitive info but keep essential transactional/financial records.

> ⚠️ Principle: deletion should be **deliberate, secure, and reversible** if appropriate, especially for sensitive applications.
